## Installation

It's a pretty simple process, first of all you need build the application:
 - Move into project dir. and execute command: `docker-compose build --no-cache` (`--no-cache` instruction should by omitted if you build the project in the first time).

Now, you can run the project:
 -  Run the application after success build: `docker-compose up`.
   
At the moment, you already can surf the address: `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` in order to see the result.
